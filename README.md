Trading tenants:

- I’m never going to be the fastest trader, I won’t win on speed.
- I’m never going to be a clever trades, I won’t win on calculations, patterns, etc.
- NEVER sell at a loss.
- Buy in micro-batches (lots) based on account size.
- Buy known assets across classes of growing markets, worst case you hold for a duration.
